# Running the Game
To run the game, download everything from github and extract to a folder. Open the shortcut titled "FBLA_Asteroids", if that does not work, open the "MARYLAND_DULANEY HIGH SCHOOL" folder, and open "FBLA_Asteroids.exe". Make sure to read the instructions before playing.

# Exiting the Game with Menus and the Escape Key
To exit the game, simply return to the main menu, all menus have a back button, however, if you are in game, you can return to the main menu by pressing escape.

# Topics, Randomization, and Question Bank
To ensure that the questions are random on each run of the levels, we use UnityEngine.Random to generate random question from a bank. The bank can be viewed here (Note: it is missing 2 questions from the first level, however, the rest of the questions are there). https://bcpscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ss407_bcps_org/EaGuM0MkvC1FmeuhWUFv-kUB29EPaQgmY0C5yCnp9PsUOQ?e=ceHel7

# A Challenging but Fun Shooter
The game can be completed extremely fast, however, that is if you know all of the questions ahead of time. The goal of the game is to teach the user about FBLA, but to also provide a challenge in dodging projectiles along the way. While inexperienced users can take 5+ tries, a more experienced user can complete the game in under 5 minutes.
