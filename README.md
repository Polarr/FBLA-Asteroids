# Running the Game
To run the game, download everything from github and extract to a folder. Open the shortcut titled "FBLA_Asteroids", if that does not work, open the "MARYLAND_DULANEY HIGH SCHOOL" folder, and open "FBLA_Asteroids.exe". Make sure to read the instructions before playing. The game utilizes the mouse and keyboard as input. You use the mouse to guide the spaceship and to navigate through menus, and the keyboard to shoot.

# Exiting the Game with Menus and the Escape Key
To exit the game, simply return to the main menu, all menus have a back button, however, if you are in game, you can return to the main menu by pressing escape.

# Topics, Randomization, and Question Bank
To ensure that the questions are random on each run of the levels, we use UnityEngine.Random to generate random question from a bank. The bank can be viewed here (Note: it is missing 2 questions from the first level, however, the rest of the questions are there). https://bcpscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ss407_bcps_org/EaGuM0MkvC1FmeuhWUFv-kUB29EPaQgmY0C5yCnp9PsUOQ?e=ceHel7

# A Challenging but Fun Shooter
The game can be completed extremely fast, however, that is if you know all of the questions ahead of time. The goal of the game is to teach the user about FBLA, but to also provide a challenge in dodging projectiles along the way. Additionally, there is a delay before enemies can shoot, this way, the user can take time to read the question and process it before they get distracted by the bullets. While inexperienced users can take 5+ tries, a more experienced user can complete the game in under 5 minutes. However, the only way a user can complete the game so quickly is because they have memorized the question bank, like I had done below. (Click on image below)

# Multiplayer
The multiplayer implementation comes in the form of a "Hall of Fame" that allows users to see other users that have previously completed the game. It is also satisfying seeing yourself up there as well. The networking is done with MySQL Database and PHP, along with Unity's webrequest system.

# C# and Multiplatform Support
The game is created with unity, thus with the proper SDK's, it can be ported to Mac and Linux, alongside windows

# Viewing Code
Simply open up the "MARYLAND_DULANEY HIGH SCHOOL" folder, and then the "Source Code" folder to get complete access to the code. Additionally, if you have the Unity Engine installed, you can open up that folder with the Unity Engine as well.

# Building Code
You will need to open the "Source Code" folder as stated before with the Unity Engine and then build it using Unity as well.

# Code Commenting
All of the code is commented to allow clear understanding of why certain lines of code may exist.
